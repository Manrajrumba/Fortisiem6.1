link = https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisiem/6.1.1/esx-installation-and-migration-guide/131018/fresh-installation#set_collector_name

after installing collector you have to create a collector name in fortisiem under the name of super...see docs how to create a collector name in siem

after that giving proper ip for collector and having communication with super,
run command 
/opt/phoenix/bin/phProvisionCollector --add <user> '<password>' <Super IP or Host> <Organization> <CollectorName>
/opt/phoenix/bin/phProvisionCollector --add admin 'VMware1!' 192.168.132.183 Super collector

@@@ note: here collector is the name of collector which is to be created in fortisiem under super @@@@
then collector will be registered and restart automatically....
