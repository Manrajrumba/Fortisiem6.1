Issue

    How to monitor the permission change and ownership change of a particular directory or file?
    How to configure auditd to find how a file was modified in Red Hat Enterprise Linux?
    What tool can audit files at a directory level?
    How do I monitor files or directories using auditd in Red Hat Enterprise Linux ?
    How do I monitor a file or directory to see which user or program has accessed or modified data ?

Resolution

    The Linux Audit system (audit package) can be used to accomplish this task.
    Ensure the auditd service is running, and set to start on boot with chkconfig auditd on
    Set a watch on the required file to be monitored by using the auditctl command:

# auditctl -w /etc/hosts -p war -k monitor-hosts


    where:
        auditctl is the command used to add entries to the audit database.
        -w inserts a watch for the file system object at path, i.e. /etc/shadow.
        -p sets permissions filter for a file system watch.
        The permission are any one of the following:
               r - read of the file
               w - write to the file
               x - execute the file
               a - change in the file's attribute
        -k sets a filter key on an audit rule. The filter key is an arbitrary string of text that can be up to 31 bytes long. It can uniquely identify the audit records produced by a rule.

Note: In order for these rules to persist after a reboot, the below must be added to the relevant rule files,

-w /etc/hosts -p a -k monitor-hosts      ##in rhel7 or centos 7 /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules


The auditd service must be restarted after any changes are made, also ensure that it is set to run on boot.

# service auditd restart
# chkconfig --list auditd
# chkconfig auditd on


In this example, a watch is placed on the /etc/hosts file for any syscalls which perform a write, read, or attribute change (-p war). 
This is logged with the key monitor-hosts. This key can be used to search through the audit logs to find these actions, using the ausearch command:


# ausearch -ts today -k monitor-hosts

Specifying a -i to ausearch also interprets numeric entities into text, making the logs more readable
